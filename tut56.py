# introduction to OOP(object oriented programing) in python 


# in programing languages mainly they use two types of approches to write a program
# 1 : procedural programing
# 2 : object oriented programing [object are the entities]

# example
# Railway form --> CLASS (BLUEPRINT WE CAN SAY)
# ANAND --> ANAND KI INFO KA FORM => {IT IS AN OBJECT [ENTITY]}
# ROHAN --> ROHAN KI INFO KA FORM => {IT IS AN OBJECT [ENTITY]}
# BINOD --> BINOD KI INFO KA FORM => {IT IS AN OBJECT [ENTITY]}
